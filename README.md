# Code Style Guidelines  

Welcome to this project! To ensure consistency and maintainability, please follow these coding guidelines while contributing.  

## 1. Indentation & Readability  

- Use **4 spaces per indentation level** (or follow project-specific guidelines).  
- Maintain **consistent indentation** throughout the codebase.  
- Keep **lines under 80 characters** for better readability.  
- Use **meaningful whitespace** to separate logical blocks of code.

## 2. Comments & Documentation  

- Use **clear and concise comments** to explain complex logic.  
- Follow **language-specific best practices** for writing comments.  
- Use **docstrings** for functions, classes, and modules in Python.  
- Avoid unnecessary or redundant comments.  

## 3. Naming Conventions  

- Use **CamelCase** for class names (e.g., `UserProfile`).  
- Use **camelCase** for variable and function names (e.g., `fetchData`).  
- Use **UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE** for constants (e.g., `MAX_LIMIT`).  
- Use **meaningful and descriptive** names.  

## 4. File & Folder Naming  

- Use **lowercase-with-hyphens** for filenames (e.g., `user-profile.js`).  
- Keep filenames **short and meaningful**.  

## 5. Version Control Best Practices  

- Use **meaningful commit messages** (e.g., `fix: resolve login issue`).  
- Follow the **branching strategy** defined in the project.  
- Always test your code before committing.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a clean and efficient codebase. Happy coding!
